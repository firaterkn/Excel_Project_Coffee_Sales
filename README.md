# Tools Used

**1. Microsoft Excel:** Microsoft Excel was instrumental in the creation of this project. It was used for data collection, cleaning, and analysis. The various features of Excel, such as pivot tables, charts, and data visualization tools, facilitated the transformation of raw data into meaningful insights.

**2. Git & GitHub:** Git and GitHub were utilized for version control and collaborative work on this project. Git, a distributed version control system, helped in tracking changes made to the project files, ensuring that every modification was documented and could be reverted if necessary.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup 
This part is very important for cleaning the data we have and obtaining accurate information. This section includes:

**1. Data Trimming:** The TRIM function was utilized to remove any leading or trailing spaces from text entries, ensuring consistency in the data.

**2. Data Type Conversion:** Functions and tools were used to convert data types as needed, such as converting text to numbers or dates to standardize formats across the dataset.

**3. Finding and Replacing Misspelling:** Excel's FIND and REPLACE functionality was used to locate and correct misspelled words, inconsistent abbreviations, and other common data entry errors.

**4. Conditional Columns:** Applied conditional columns to highlight additional data, such as finding the total price by multiplying the product price and quantity, for easier data review.

**5. Sorting and Filtering:** These basic yet powerful tools were employed to organize data and isolate subsets of interest for detailed analysis. Such as using the date function to get only the hour part of the given date.
