# Data Preparation and Cleanup 
This part is very important for cleaning the data we have and obtaining accurate information. This section includes:

**1. Data Trimming:** The TRIM function was utilized to remove any leading or trailing spaces from text entries, ensuring consistency in the data.

**2. Data Type Conversion:** Functions and tools were used to convert data types as needed, such as converting text to numbers or dates to standardize formats across the dataset.

**3. Finding and Replacing Misspelling:** Excel's FIND and REPLACE functionality was used to locate and correct misspelled words, inconsistent abbreviations, and other common data entry errors.

**4. Conditional Columns:** Applied conditional columns to highlight additional data, such as finding the total price by multiplying the product price and quantity, for easier data review.

**5. Sorting and Filtering:** These basic yet powerful tools were employed to organize data and isolate subsets of interest for detailed analysis. Such as using the date function to get only the hour part of the given date.

## Sales and Customer Insights
### Quantity per Hour

**Peak Hours:** The data reveals that the busiest hours are between 8 AM and 10 AM, with quantities sold exceeding 25,000 during these times. This suggests that the coffee shops are popular destinations for morning beverages, likely catering to the breakfast crowd and commuters.

**Off-Peak Hours:** Sales drop significantly after 10 AM, shows that customer engagement is lower once working hours begin.

### Top 5 Products

The most popular products are identified, with Barista Espresso leading at 25%, followed by  Brewed Chai Tea (22%), Gourmet Brewed Coffee (20%), Hot chocolate and Brewed Black Tea (13%). These preferences highlight the importance of coffee and tea in our product mix.

### Size Distribution

The distribution of product sizes shows that Regular (31%) and Large (30%) sizes are the most popular among customers. The Not Defined category also holds a significant share (30%), suggesting a potential area for better product categorization. Small size has the least preference at 9%.

## Orders Insights

### Orders per Day

**Weekly Trends:** Orders peak on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, indicating higher customer activity towards start and the end of the week. The data shows that Saturday has the lowest number of orders, suggesting this day might be quieter.

### Top 5 Categories

**Sales by Category:** The top categories contributing to our sales include Coffee ($269,952), Tea ($196,406), Bakery items ($82,316), Drinking Chocolate ($72,416) and Flavours ($8,409). This breakdown helps in understanding which categories are driving sales and which may need promotional efforts.

## Location Performance

### Footfall and Sales Over Various Locations

**Location Analysis:** The data indicates that our Astoria and Hell's Kitchen locations are leading in both footfall and sales, with 50,599 and 50,735 visitors generating $232,243.91 and $236,511.17 in sales respectively.
